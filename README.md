#taskmanager - Implemented in Javascript, not Typescript. Misread the tech stack

Setting up the database:

• Initialised a perntodo database with psql. • Defined a "users" table and a "tasks" table with a foreign key called "userid" mapping each task to its user. • Estabilished connection to database with the pg library. Set up this connection in a separate file, db.js.

How to run the backend:

• cd into server directory, then run command "nodemon index.js". Will restart the server whenever file is changed and saved.

How to run the frontend:

• cd into client directory, then run command "npm start".

Testing:

• I wrote the backend first, used Postman as a tool for testing the CRUD operations.

Salary Expectations:

• I’m looking for a monthly salary of around $3,400 for a full-time position, based on an hourly rate of $20. If the position is part-time, my expectation would be adjusted accordingly based on hours worked.
